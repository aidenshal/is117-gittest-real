# Linux Command Guide ‚Äì In-Class Test (30 min)# TinyTools Calculator ‚Äì In-Class Test (30 min)



## Scenario## Scenario

You've just been hired as a **Junior Documentation Specialist** at **TechStart Academy**, a coding bootcamp that teaches beginners how to use Linux. Your manager needs you to create a **beginner-friendly Linux command reference guide** using professional Git workflow and Markdown formatting.You‚Äôve joined **TinyTools, Inc.** Deliver a production-ready **Python Calculator** library with four operations:



Your first assignment:- **add**, **subtract**, **multiply**, **divide**  

- Create a well-organized guide covering **basic Linux commands** (file operations, navigation, text viewing, and system info)- **Divide by zero must raise `ZeroDivisionError`.**

- Use **proper Markdown formatting** (headers, lists, code blocks, tables)

- Follow **professional Git workflow** with atomic commitsYour team enforces professional workflow:  

- Build the documentation **incrementally** with clear commit history- **Brand-new repo**  

- **Atomic commits** with required prefixes  

Your manager emphasizes:  - Pass **linting**  

- "We need to see your work progress through Git commits"- All **tests** must pass  

- "Each section should be added in its own commit"- **100% test coverage** required  

- "Use professional commit message prefixes so we can track documentation changes"

## Commit Rules

## Commit Rules- Every commit message **must** start with one of:  

- Every commit message **must** start with one of:    - `chore:` ‚Äî setup/config/docs  

  - `docs:` ‚Äî adding or updating documentation content  - `feature:` ‚Äî new functionality **and its tests**  

  - `chore:` ‚Äî setup, configuration, or project structure  - `fix:` ‚Äî bug fix or correcting a test  

  - `fix:` ‚Äî correcting errors or improving existing content

- **Atomic history**:

- **Atomic commits**:  - Each calculator function (**add, subtract, multiply, divide**) must be delivered in **its own commit**, with the tests **and** the implementation together.  

  - Each documentation file should be added in **its own commit**  - Do **not** put multiple functions in one commit.  

  - Each major content addition gets **its own commit**  - Do **not** split one function across multiple commits.

  - Do **not** put multiple unrelated changes in one commit

  - Do **not** split one logical addition across multiple commits- **Minimum 8 commits** required (more is fine; do not squash).



- **Minimum 8 commits** required (more is fine; do not squash)### Example Commit Timeline

1. `chore: initialize repo with README and requirements`

### Example Commit Timeline2. `chore: add project skeleton (src, tests) and setup notes`

1. `chore: initialize repository with README template`3. `chore: document how to run lint/tests in README`

2. `chore: create docs directory structure`4. `feature: implement add() with unit tests`

3. `docs: add navigation commands guide`5. `feature: implement subtract() with unit tests`

4. `docs: add file operations guide`6. `feature: implement multiply() with unit tests`

5. `docs: add text viewing commands guide`7. `feature: implement divide() with unit tests including divide-by-zero`

6. `docs: add system information commands guide`8. `chore: add coverage command and enforce 100% in README`

7. `docs: add table of contents to README`9. *(if needed)* `fix: correct edge case in subtract() test`

8. `docs: add examples and tips section`10. *(if needed)* `fix: address pylint error in calculator module`

9. *(if needed)* `fix: correct mkdir command syntax in file-operations.md`

10. *(if needed)* `docs: add additional examples to navigation.md`---



---## Local Commands (before pushing)

```bash

## Content Requirements# Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Each Guide File Must Include:

1. **Header** (level 1 or 2)# Lint (must be clean)

2. **Command list** with descriptionspylint --errors-only src

3. **Code blocks** showing command syntax

4. **Examples** of actual usage# Run tests

5. **Tips or warnings** (using blockquotes or emphasis)PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests -v

PYTHONPATH=src pytest --pylint src -v

### Markdown Elements You Must Use:

- Headers (`#`, `##`, `###`)# Coverage (must be 100%)

- Lists (bulleted or numbered)PYTHONPATH=src coverage run -m pytest tests

- Code blocks with triple backtickscoverage report --fail-under=100

- Inline code with single backticks````

- **Bold** or *italic* text for emphasis

- Tables (at least one)---

- Blockquotes (optional but recommended)

## How Grading Works

---

Your repository is graded entirely by the **GitHub Actions workflow** in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or initialize your repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <repo-name>
   ```

2. **Create the structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir docs
   touch docs/navigation.md docs/file-operations.md docs/text-commands.md docs/system-info.md
   ```

3. **Make atomic commits as you add content**
   ```bash
   git add <files>
   git commit -m "docs: add navigation commands guide"
   git push
   ```

4. **Check your work locally** (optional but recommended)
   - Preview your Markdown files in VS Code or GitHub
   - Verify all files are created
   - Count your commits: `git log --oneline | wc -l`

## Tips for Success

- ‚è∞ **Time management**: Spend ~3-4 minutes per guide file
- üìù **Start simple**: Add basic content first, enhance later if time permits
- üîÑ **Commit often**: It's better to have too many commits than too few
- ‚úÖ **Check requirements**: Use the rubric as a checklist
- üöÄ **Push frequently**: Don't wait until the end to push all commits

---

## Submission

- Push to GitHub and share the repository URL
- Your **last commit** must be before the 30-minute deadline
- Make sure you've pushed **all commits** to the remote repository
- The automated grader will run immediately after the deadline
