## The 15 Questions



**Question 1:** What does `git status` do?

Answer **15 questions** (5 about Git, 10 about Linux commands). Each question must be completed on its own feature branch and merged back to main.You've just been hired as a **Junior Documentation Specialist** at **TechStart Academy**, a coding bootcamp that teaches beginners how to use Linux. Your manager needs you to create a **beginner-friendly Linux command reference guide** using professional Git workflow and Markdown formatting.You’ve joined **TinyTools, Inc.** Deliver a production-ready **Python Calculator** library with four operations:

**Question 2:** What is the difference between `git add` and `git commit`?



**Question 3:** What is a branch in Git?

### Required Workflow for EACH Question:---

**Question 4:** What does `git merge` do?



**Question 5:** What is the difference between `git pull` and `git push`?

1. Create a feature branch (`question-01`, `question-02`, etc.)

**Question 6:** What does the `pwd` command do?

2. Create/edit the answer file in the `answers/` directory

**Question 7:** How do you change directories with `cd`? Show 3 ways.

3. Stage and commit your changes with proper message prefix## Your Task

**Question 8:** What does `ls -la` show you that `ls` does not?

4. Switch back to main branch

**Question 9:** How do you create a new directory?

5. Merge your feature branch into mainYour first assignment:- **add**, **subtract**, **multiply**, **divide**  

**Question 10:** What is the difference between absolute and relative paths?

6. Repeat for next question

**Question 11:** How do you create an empty file in Linux?

Answer **15 questions** about Git and Linux commands. Each question must be completed on its own branch and merged back to main.

**Question 12:** What is the difference between `cp` and `mv`?

---

**Question 13:** Why is `rm -rf` dangerous?

- Create a well-organized guide covering **basic Linux commands** (file operations, navigation, text viewing, and system info)- **Divide by zero must raise `ZeroDivisionError`.**

**Question 14:** What does the `cat` command do?

## Example Workflow

**Question 15:** How do you view the last 20 lines of a file?

### Required Workflow (FOR EACH QUESTION):

---

Here's exactly how to complete Question 1:

## Commit Rules

- Use **proper Markdown formatting** (headers, lists, code blocks, tables)

Start every commit with:

- `docs:` for answers```bash

- `chore:` for setup

- `fix:` for corrections# Step 1: Create feature branch for question 11. **Create a feature branch** for the question



Example: `docs: answer question 5`git checkout -b question-01



---2. **Create/edit the answer file** - Follow **professional Git workflow** with atomic commitsYour team enforces professional workflow:  



## Grading (100 pts)# Step 2: Create and edit your answer file



- 20 pts: 15+ commits# (Use your editor to write the answer in answers/question-01.md)3. **Commit with proper message prefix**

- 25 pts: All commits have correct prefix

- 20 pts: 15 branches created

- 15 pts: Branches merged

- 15 pts: All 15 files exist# Step 3: Stage and commit4. **Switch back to main**- Build the documentation **incrementally** with clear commit history- **Brand-new repo**  

- 5 pts: Files have content

git add answers/question-01.md

---

git commit -m "docs: answer question 1 about git status"5. **Merge the branch**

## Start Here



```bash

# 1. Setup# Step 4: Switch back to main6. **Repeat for next question**- **Atomic commits** with required prefixes  

mkdir answers

git add answers/git checkout main

git commit -m "chore: create answers directory"



# 2. Do question 1

git checkout -b question-01# Step 5: Merge your work

# write your answer in answers/question-01.md

git add answers/question-01.mdgit merge question-01---Your manager emphasizes:  - Pass **linting**  

git commit -m "docs: answer question 1"

git checkout main

git merge question-01

# Now repeat for question-02, question-03, etc...

# 3. Repeat for questions 2-15

``````



---## Example Workflow- "We need to see your work progress through Git commits"- All **tests** must pass  



## You Can Use Google/ChatGPT**Hint:** You'll do this pattern 15 times (once per question)!



We grade your Git workflow, not your answers!

---

**Question 8:** What does `ls -la` show you that `ls` alone does not?- **Atomic history**:

**Question 14:** What does the `cat` command do? Provide an example use case.



**Hint:** It displays entire file contents in the terminal...

**Question 9:** How do you create a new directory? Provide the command and an example.- **Atomic commits**:  - Each calculator function (**add, subtract, multiply, divide**) must be delivered in **its own commit**, with the tests **and** the implementation together.  

---



**Question 15:** How would you view the last 20 lines of a log file?

**Question 10:** What's the difference between absolute and relative paths? Give examples.  - Each documentation file should be added in **its own commit**  - Do **not** put multiple functions in one commit.  

**Hint:** `tail -n 20 filename` or `tail -20 filename`



---

### Linux File Operations (Questions 11-15)  - Each major content addition gets **its own commit**  - Do **not** split one function across multiple commits.

## Commit Message Rules



Every commit message **must** start with one of these prefixes:

**Question 11:** How do you create an empty file in Linux? Provide the command.  - Do **not** put multiple unrelated changes in one commit

- `docs:` — Adding or updating documentation/answers

- `chore:` — Setup, configuration, or structural changes  

- `fix:` — Correcting an error in your answer

**Question 12:** Explain the difference between `cp` and `mv` commands.  - Do **not** split one logical addition across multiple commits- **Minimum 8 commits** required (more is fine; do not squash).

### Good Examples:

```

docs: answer question 1 about git status

docs: answer question 2 about git add vs commit**Question 13:** Why is the `rm -rf` command dangerous? How can you be safer?

fix: correct explanation in question 4

chore: create answers directory

```

**Question 14:** What does the `cat` command do? Provide an example use case.- **Minimum 8 commits** required (more is fine; do not squash)### Example Commit Timeline

### Bad Examples (will lose points):

```

## Tips for Success

**Total: 100 points**- **Bold** or *italic* text for emphasis

### ⏰ Time Management

- **2 minutes per question** is your target pace

- Don't spend more than 3 minutes on any single question

- Simple answers are fine - this isn't graded on quality!---- Tables (at least one)---

- Set a timer and stick to it



### 🔄 Git Workflow

- Create branch → edit file → commit → merge - **keep this rhythm**## Getting Started- Blockquotes (optional but recommended)

- Don't forget to go back to `main` before merging!

- If you mess up, it's okay - just keep going

- Push your work every 5-10 minutes so you don't lose it

### Step 1: Clone and Setup## How Grading Works

### ✅ Answer Quality (Don't Stress!)

- **2-4 sentences is plenty** for most questions```bash

- Include a command example when relevant

- Use ChatGPT or Google - we don't care!git clone <your-repo-url>---

- Focus on Git workflow, not perfect answers

cd <repo-name>

### 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Forgetting to create feature branches (work directly on main)mkdir answersYour repository is graded entirely by the **GitHub Actions workflow** in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

- ❌ Wrong commit message prefixes (no prefix or wrong format)

- ❌ Not merging branches back to maingit add answers/

- ❌ Creating all files at once instead of one per commit

- ❌ Spending too much time on answer qualitygit commit -m "chore: create answers directory"## Commands to DocumentIf any step fails, you lose points for that category.

```

### Step 3: Verify Your Work

### Checking Your Progress

```bash```bash- `cd` - change directory| # | CI Job / Step         | Requirement                                                   | Points | Pass                                    | Fail                 |

```



### If You Get Stuck

```bash# Check branches created| 1 | **Commit Policy**     | ≥ 8 commits                                                   |     20 | CI shows “Commit count requirement met” | Fewer than 8 commits |

git status                       # Where am I? What's changed?

git branch                       # What branch am I on?git branch -a

pwd                             # What directory am I in?

```### File Operations (file-operations.md)| 2 | **Commit Policy**     | All commit messages start with `chore:` / `feature:` / `fix:` |     20 | All messages valid                      | Any message invalid  |



---# Check all files exist



## Example Answer Formatls answers/- `mkdir` - make directory| 3 | **Project Structure** | `README.md`, `requirements.txt`, `src/`, `tests/` present     |     10 | All present                             | Any missing          |



Your answer files should be simple markdown. Here's an example:```



**File: `answers/question-01.md`**- `touch` - create empty file| 4 | **Lint Check**        | `pylint --errors-only src` clean                              |     15 | No errors                               | Any error            |



```markdown### Step 4: Push Everything

# Question 1: What does git status do?

```bash- `cp` - copy files/directories| 5 | **Pytest-Pylint**     | `pytest --pylint src -v` passes                               |      5 | Pass                                    | Fail                 |

## Answer

git push origin main

`git status` shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. 

It tells you which files are modified, staged, or untracked.git push --all  # Push all branches- `mv` - move or rename files| 6 | **Unit Tests**        | `pytest tests -v` passes                                      |     15 | All tests pass                          | Any fail             |



You use it before committing to see what changes will be included.```



## Example- `rm` - remove files/directories| 7 | **Coverage**          | `coverage report --fail-under=100` shows 100%                 |     15 | Exactly 100%                            | < 100%               |



\`\`\`bash---

$ git status

On branch main

Changes not staged for commit:

```### Text Commands (text-commands.md)**Total = 100 points**



That's it! Simple and quick. Don't overthink it!⏰ **Time Management**



---- ~2 minutes per question- `cat` - display file contents



## Submission- Create branch → answer → commit → merge



1. **Push all your commits to GitHub:**- Don't overthink answers - you can use any resources- `less` - view file with pagination---

   ```bash

   git push origin main

   git push --all

   ```🔄 **Git Workflow**- `head` - show first lines of file



2. **Verify on GitHub** that you can see:- Keep commits atomic (one per question)

   - Your commit history (15+ commits)

   - All answer files in the `answers/` folder- Always merge back to main after each question- `tail` - show last lines of file## Submission

   - Proper commit message prefixes

- Push frequently to avoid losing work

3. **Your last commit must be before the 30-minute deadline**



4. **The auto-grader runs automatically** and will show your score in the GitHub Actions tab

✅ **Answer Quality**

---

- Answers don't need to be long (2-4 sentences is fine)### System Info (system-info.md)* Push to GitHub/GitLab and share the repo URL **OR** upload a zip including `.git` history.

## FAQs

- Include command examples when relevant

**Q: Can I really use ChatGPT or Google?**  

A: Yes! This test is about Git workflow, not memorizing commands.- Use ChatGPT or Google - this is about Git, not memorization- `whoami` - current username* Your **last commit** must be before the 30-minute deadline.



**Q: How detailed should my answers be?**  

A: 2-4 sentences with an example is plenty. We're not grading content!

🚨 **Common Mistakes to Avoid**- `hostname` - computer name

**Q: What if I make a mistake in my answer?**  

A: You can fix it later with a `fix:` commit if you have time, but don't worry too much.- Forgetting to create a branch- `date` - current date/time



**Q: Do I need to push after every commit?**  - Working on main instead of feature branches- `uname` - system information

A: No, but push every 5-10 minutes so you don't lose work if something happens.

- Missing the commit message prefix

**Q: What if I can't finish all 15 questions?**  

A: Do as many as you can! Partial credit is given. But 15 questions in 30 minutes is definitely doable if you stay focused on Git workflow, not answer perfection.- Not merging back to main---



**Q: Can I work on multiple questions before merging?**  

A: No - merge each branch back to main before starting the next one. That's the workflow we're testing!

---## How Grading Works

## Remember

## SubmissionYour repository is graded entirely by the **GitHub Actions workflow** in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

This is a **Git workflow proficiency test**. Your score depends on:

- ✅ Following the branch-based workflow correctlyIf any step fails, you lose points for that category.

- ✅ Using proper commit message prefixes

- ✅ Creating all required files1. **Push all commits to GitHub**

- ❌ NOT on how perfect your answers are

   ```bash### Rubric (100 pts total)

## Quick Reference## Getting Started



### Branch Workflow Pattern1. **Clone or initialize your repository**

```bash   ```bash

git checkout -b question-XX          # Create branch   git clone <your-repo-url>

# Edit file   cd <repo-name>

git add answers/question-XX.md       # Stage changes   ```

git commit -m "docs: answer question XX about TOPIC"

git checkout main                     # Back to main2. **Create the structure**

git merge question-XX                 # Merge branch   ```bash

```   mkdir docs

   touch docs/navigation.md docs/file-operations.md docs/text-commands.md docs/system-info.md

### Useful Git Commands   ```

```bash

git status                           # Check current state3. **Make atomic commits as you add content**

git log --oneline                    # View commit history   ```bash

git branch                           # List branches   git add <files>

git branch -a                        # List all branches including remote   git commit -m "docs: add navigation commands guide"

```   git push

   ```

Good luck! Remember: **This is a Git workflow test, not a memorization test.** 🚀

4. **Check your work locally** (optional but recommended)
   - Preview your Markdown files in VS Code or GitHub
   - Verify all files are created
   - Count your commits: `git log --oneline | wc -l`

## Tips for Success

- ⏰ **Time management**: Spend ~3-4 minutes per guide file
- 📝 **Start simple**: Add basic content first, enhance later if time permits
- 🔄 **Commit often**: It's better to have too many commits than too few
- ✅ **Check requirements**: Use the rubric as a checklist
- 🚀 **Push frequently**: Don't wait until the end to push all commits

---

## Submission

- Push to GitHub and share the repository URL
- Your **last commit** must be before the 30-minute deadline
- Make sure you've pushed **all commits** to the remote repository
- The automated grader will run immediately after the deadline
