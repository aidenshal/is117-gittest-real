# Question 7: How do you change directories using the `cd` command? Show three different ways.

## Answer

The `cd` command changes your current directory. Here are three ways to use it:

## Three Ways

1. **Go to a specific directory:**
```bash
cd documents
```

2. **Go to home directory:**
```bash
cd ~
# or just
cd
```

3. **Go up one level:**
```bash
cd ..
```

You can also use absolute paths like `cd /home/student/documents` or relative paths like `cd ../projects`.
