# Question 6: What does the `pwd` command do? Provide an example output.

## Answer

`pwd` stands for "Print Working Directory". It shows you the full path of the directory you're currently in.

This is useful when you're navigating through the file system and want to know exactly where you are.

## Example

```bash
$ pwd
/home/student/documents/projects
```

This tells you that you're in the `projects` folder, inside `documents`, inside the `student` home directory.
