# Question 11: How do you create an empty file in Linux? Provide the command.

## Answer

Use the `touch` command to create empty files.

## Examples

```bash
# Create one file
touch notes.txt

# Create multiple files
touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt

# Create file in another directory
touch documents/report.txt
```

If the file already exists, `touch` just updates its timestamp without changing the content.
